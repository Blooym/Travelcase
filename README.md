## About 
Travelcase is a plugin that lets you set per-character per-zone gearsets and glamours. When entering a specified zone, the plugin will automatically change your gear and glamour to the specified set as long as it is valid and passes the validation checks.

## Features
- Set per-character per-zone gearsets and glamours
- "Roleplay Only" mode to only change gear and glamour when you have the RP status enabled
- Full localization support
- Supports a large number of zones, and will automatically add new zones when they are added to the game
